runtime grammar
 - hack together runtime rules
 - generate
   - generate code and dynamically link against it
   - generate embedded language and run against that
   - generate backbone and run interpreter

Slab allocator for nodes and node components
 - would be able to copy nodes
 - pulls from component sets
 - extend capability through compiler

'is' the type map
 - con: how is the compiler supposed to be able to preoptimize if it's a static map? gotta see if it'll do it
 - it's going to be generated/made anyways.

changing grammar
 - the grammar is going to need to change as time goes on anyways.

something to figure out if a texp matches any part of a grammar
